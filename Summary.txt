Here is a short summary of how i cleaned the Raw Data 
1) I have used the Sample Sales Data for Cleaning using MS Excel
2) Checked for the Duplicate values if any, There were none in the Dataset.
3) Filled the missing values with 0/Unknown and Removed errors.
4) Merged cells (First Name & Last Name) Renamed as Contact Person
5) Replaced Values in Columns Country USA to United States & UK to United Kingdom.
6) Merged cells (Address 1 & address 2) Renamed as Address.
7) Change Data type of Date as Date & Time, Phone Number to Whole Number.
8) Converted date format to dd-mm-yyyy.
9) Renamed all Column Headers to Lowercase using Underscore to separate the words.
10) Verified and fixed datatypes for all Column Headers.
